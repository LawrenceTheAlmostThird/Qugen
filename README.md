# Qugen
A question generator built with OpenNLP.

To use, open project with Intellij IDE, and make sure the folders "openNLP" and "super-csv-distrubution-2.4.0-bin" are added as libraries.
Then run src/com.company/main.class with the input parameter -h.
This should print the help file, providing further instruction, and satisfy the first task on the project contract.

To test task 1b on the contract, try running the program with "output.txt "It is meant to generate questions about factual, declarative statements."".
To test task 2a on the contract, try running the program with "output.txt "This is a test sentence."".
To test task 2b on the contract, try running the program with "-fc output.txt input.txt". The file input.txt should be in the format specified by the help messege.
To test task 3 on the contract, try running the program with "-n output.txt "These are some words that I am wishing to normalize."".
To test task 4 on the contract, try running the program with "output.txt "I am a student."".
To test task 5a on the contract, try running the program with "output.txt "I am a student."".
To test task 5b on the contract, try running the program with "output.txt "Johnny gave me a bowl of cereal."", or any other complex sentence you wish.
To test task 6b on the contract, try running the program with "output.txt "It is meant to generate questions about factual, declarative statements."".
